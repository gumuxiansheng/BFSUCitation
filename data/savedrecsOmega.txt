AB In this paper, unique surface sensing property and enhanced sensitivity
   in microring resonator biosensors based on subwavelength grating (SWG)
   waveguides are studied and demonstrated. The SWG structure consists of
   periodic silicon pillars in the propagation direction with a
   subwavelength period. Effective sensing region in the SWG microring
   resonator includes not only the top and side of the waveguide, but also
   the space between the silicon pillars on the light propagation path. It
   leads to greatly increased sensitivity and a unique surface sensing
   property in contrast to common evanescent wave sensors: the surface
   sensitivity remains constantly high as the surface layer thickness
   grows. Microring resonator biosensors based on both SWG waveguides and
   conventional strip waveguides were compared side by side in surface
   sensing experiment and the enhanced surface sensing capability in SWG
   based microring resonator biosensors was demonstrated.

AB Bolivia is one of the countries with a high intestinal helminth and
   protozoan infection rate. Despite the high prevalence of the parasitic
   infection, nationwide preventive measures for Bolivian children have not
   yet been implemented. We evaluated the effect of mass stool examination
   and treatment as a strategy for decreasing the infection rate. This
   study was conducted between 2013 and 2015 in children aged 2-18 years. A
   total of 2,033 stool samples (575 in 2013, 815 in 2014 and 642 in 2015)
   were collected and examined using the formalin-ether medical
   sedimentation method. As an anthelminthic medicine, nitazoxanide was
   given to all infected children within 2 months post-examination, each
   year. The effect of mass stool examination and treatment was evaluated
   based on the changes in the overall or individual parasitic infection
   rates during the study period. The overall parasitic infection rate
   decreased significantly from 65.2% in 2013 to 43.0% in 2015; a 22.2
   percentage point decrease (P<0.001). Protozoan infection accounted for a
   large portion of the parasitic infections, in the following rates: 62.4%
   in 2013, 49.3% in 2014, and 41.0% in 2015. The rate of the most common
   helminth infection, Hymenolepis nana, decreased significantly from 9.0%
   in 2013 to 6.4% in 2014 to 3.4% in 2015 (P<0.001). Prevalence of the
   most common pathogenic protozoan infection, Entamoeba histolytica,
   decreased significantly from 19.0% in 2013 to 3.0% in 2015 (P<0.001).
   Conversely, the rate of Giardia intestinalis increased significantly
   from 16.5% in 2013 to 21.2% in 2015 (P<0.01). Mass stool examination and
   treatment for intestinal helminth and protozoan infections was effective
   for decreasing the overall parasitic infection rate in the study
   population, excluding Giardia intestinalis. Further studies on the
   long-term effect of mass stool examination and treatment for decreasing
   all intestinal parasitic infection rates in Bolivian children are
   needed.

AB In an on-chip silicon-organic hybrid electro-optic (EO) modulator, the
   mode overlap with EO materials, in-device effective r<sub>33</sub>, and
   propagation loss are among the most critical factors that determine the
   performance of the modulator. Various waveguide structures have been
   proposed to optimize these factors, yet there is a lack of comprehensive
   consideration on all of them. In this Letter, a one-dimensional (1D)
   photonic crystal (PC) slot waveguide structure is proposed that takes
   all these factors into consideration. The proposed structure takes
   advantage of the strong mode confinement within a low-index region in a
   conventional slot waveguide and the slow-light enhancement from the 1D
   PC structure. Its simple geometry makes it robust to resist fabrication
   imperfections and helps reduce the propagation loss. Using it as a phase
   shifter in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer structure, an integrated
   silicon-organic hybrid EO modulator was experimentally demonstrated. The
   observed effective EO coefficient is as high as 490 pm/V. The measured
   half-wave voltage and length product is less than 1V·cm and can be
   further improved. A potential bandwidth of 61 GHz can be achieved and
   further improved by tailoring the doping profile. The proposed structure
   offers a competitive novel phase-shifter design, which is simple, highly
   efficient, and with low optical loss, for on-chip silicon-organic hybrid
   EO modulators.

   calculated during the whole study of 4 weeks. Analyses of insulin and
   insulin-like growth factor (IGF 1), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine
   (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were performed at the end of
   the study. The results show that birds on supplementation of KiFAY
   performed significantly (p<0.001) better than other treatments. The
   weekly body weight, body weight gain, feed in-take and feed consumption
   ratio improved in KiFAY treated birds. The study found an increase in
   insulin and IGF1 levels (p<0.001) in KiFAY compared with the other
   treatments. Serum T3, T4, and TSH levels in the Treatment 2 were higher
   than other treatments (p<0.001). The KiFAY supplementation was able to
   improve performance with associated responses at a hormonal level in
   broilers.

AB AimThis was the first study to investigate the factors associated with
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in nonambulatory children with
   cerebral palsy (CP), based on a HRQoL measure specifically developed for
   this population.
   MethodsThe Dutch version of the Caregiver Priorities and Child Health
   Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD-DV) was used to measure HRQoL.
   It was completed by 66 parents of 47 boys and 19 girls with
   nonambulatory CP aged between five and 18 years with gross motor
   function classification system (GMFCS) levels of IV and V. Factors
   measured were the child's motor and cognitive impairments,
   comorbidities, pain, parents' education and occupations and family
   structure. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine
   the significant factors and the relative contribution of these factors
   to the CPCHILD-DV scores.
   ResultsThe most important factors associated with poorer HRQoL scores
   were pain and hospital admissions in the previous six months. Other
   factors were as follows: increased GMFCS level, feeding by gastrostomy
   tube, inability to communicate verbally, cognitive impairment, poor
   seizure control and higher parents' educational qualifications.
   ConclusionPain and hospital admissions were the most important factors
   that were negatively associated with HRQoL in nonambulatory children
   with CP between five to 18 years.

AB Dubrovnik was an important trade city throughout the medieval and
   post-medieval time period, maintaining its own glass production from the
   14th to the 16th century. Unfortunately, Dubrovnik glass discoveries
   have not been well investigated up until now, except via archival data
   in large data analyses. In the following work, we will shed new light on
   the glass material found in this region, which has diverse origins,
   chronology, typology and style. Medieval and post-medieval glass finds
   (10th/12th-18th centuries) discovered during archaeological excavations
   in Dubrovnik and the Dubrovnik region were analysed using
   particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and particle-induced gamma-ray
   emission (PIGE), which revealed three main compositional groups: natron
   glass, plant-ash glass and potash glass. This demonstrates the important
   commercial links present between Dubrovnik and other major glass-making
   centres.

AB Subwavelength grating waveguide-based micro-ring resonators (SWGMRs) are
   a promising platform for research in light-matter interaction. However,
   it is extremely difficult to achieve small radius SWGMR devices (e.g., 5
   mum) with satisfying quality factors (e.g., 10,000). One major issue is
   the large bend loss of small radius SWGMRs. In this work, we report the
   use of trapezoidal silicon pillars instead of conventional rectangular
   silicon pillars as building blocks of SWGMRs. We found that an
   asymmetric effective refractive index profile created by trapezoidal
   silicon pillars can significantly reduce the bend loss and therefore
   increase the quality factors of SWGMRs. For the first time to the best
   of our knowledge, we have experimentally demonstrated a 5 mum radius
   SWGMR made of trapezoidal silicon pillars (T-SWGMR) with an applicable
   quality factor as high as 11,500, 4.6 times of that (2800) offered by a
   conventional SWGMR made of rectangular silicon pillars, which indicates
   an 81.4% reduction of the propagation loss. This approach can also be
   readily employed to enhance SWGMRs with larger radii. We have also
   experimentally demonstrated a 10 mum radius T-SWGMR with a quality
   factor as high as 45,000, which indicates a propagation loss as low as
   6.07 dB/cm.

AB Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) affects approximately 70% of men and 40% of
   women in an age-dependent manner and is partially mediated by androgen
   hormones. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) similarly affects 50% of
   the male population, rising by 10% each decade. Finasteride inhibits
   5-alpha reductase (5AR) and is used to treat both disorders, despite
   offering limited clinical benefits accompanied by significant adverse
   side effects. Building on our previous work demonstrating the efficacy
   of naturally derived 5AR inhibitors (such as stigmasterol and beta
   sitosterol), we hypothesize that targeting 5AR as well as inflammatory
   pathways may yield improved efficacy in AGA and BPH. Here we address
   these dual pathomechanisms by examining the potency of a novel
   composition using in vitro assays of representative cell lines for AGA
   (hair follicle dermal papilla cells) and BPH (LNCaP prostate cells),
   respectively. Exposure of cells to the novel test composition
   down-regulated mRNA expression profiles characteristic of both disease
   processes, which outperformed finasteride. Changes in mRNA expression
   were corroborated at the protein level as assessed by western blotting.
   These studies provide proof of concept that novel, naturally derived
   compositions simultaneously targeting 5AR and inflammatory mediators may
   represent a rational approach to treating AGA and BPH. Copyright © 2016

AB Subwavelength grating (SWG) waveguide is an intriguing alternative to
   conventional optical waveguides due to the extra degree of freedom it
   offers in tuning a few important waveguide properties, such as
   dispersion and refractive index. Devices based on SWG waveguides have
   demonstrated impressive performances compared to conventional
   waveguides. However, the high loss of SWG waveguide bends jeopardizes
   their applications in integrated photonic circuits. In this work, we
   propose a geometrical tuning art, which realizes a pre-distorted
   refractive index profile in SWG waveguide bends. The pre-distorted
   refractive index profile can effectively reduce the mode mismatch and
   radiation loss simultaneously, thus significantly reduce the bend loss.
   This geometry tuning art has been numerically optimized and
   experimentally demonstrated in present study. Through such tuning, the
   average insertion loss of a 5mum SWG waveguide bend is reduced
   drastically from 5.43dB to 1.10dB per 90° bend for quasi-TE
   polarization. In the future, the proposed scheme will be utilized to
   enhance performance of a wide range of SWG waveguide based photonics
   devices.

AB In contrast to earlier long-chain (LC) omega-3 (i.e. EPA and DHA)
   investigations, some recent studies have not demonstrated significant
   effects of EPA and DHA on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. The
   neutral findings may have been due to experimental design issues, such
   as: maintenance on aggressive cardiovascular drug treatment
   overshadowing the benefits of LC omega-3s, high background LC omega-3
   intake, too few subjects in the study, treatment duration too short,
   insufficient LC omega-3 dosage, increase in omega-6 fatty acid intake
   during the study, failure to assess the LC omega-3 status of the
   subjects prior to and during treatment and lack of clarity concerning
   which mechanisms were expected to produce benefits. At the 11th ISSFAL
   Congress, a workshop was held on conducting LC omega-3 clinical trials
   with cardiovascular outcomes, with the goal of gaining a better
   understanding concerning aspects of experimental design that should be
   considered when planning clinical studies related to EPA and DHA and

AB High-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption
   spectrometry (HR-CS GF AAS) has been applied for the development of a
   method for the determination of total As in fish oil samples using
   direct analysis. The method does not use any sample pretreatment,
   besides dilution with 1-propanole, in order to decrease the oil
   viscosity. The stability and sensitivity of As were evaluated using
   ruthenium and iridium as permanent chemical modifiers and palladium
   added in solution over the sample. The best results were obtained with
   ruthenium as the permanent modifier and palladium in solution added to
   samples and standard solutions. Under these conditions, aqueous standard
   solutions could be used for calibration for the fish oil samples diluted
   with 1-propanole. The pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were 1400
   °C and 2300 °C, respectively, and the limit of detection and
   characteristic mass were 30 pg and 43 pg, respectively. Accuracy and
   precision of the method have been evaluated using microwave-assisted
   acid digestion of the samples with subsequent determination by HR-CS GF
   AAS and ICP-MS; the results were in agreement (95% confidence level)
   with those of the proposed method.

AB Nutrition is complex-and seemingly getting more complicated. Most
   consumers are familiar with "essential nutrients," e.g., vitamins and
   minerals, and more recently protein and important amino acids. These
   essential nutrients have nutrient reference values, referred to as
   dietary reference intakes (DRIs) developed by consensus committees of
   scientific experts convened by the Institute of Medicine of the National
   Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and carried out by the
   Food and Nutrition Board. The DRIs comprise a set of four nutrient-based
   reverence values, the estimated average requirements, the recommended
   dietary allowances (RDAs), the adequate intakes and the tolerable upper
   intake levels for micronutrient intakes and an acceptable macronutrient
   distribution range for macronutrient intakes. From the RDA, the US Food
   and Drug Administration (FDA) derives a labeling value called the daily
   value (DV), which appears on the nutrition label of all foods for sale
   in the US. The DRI reports do not make recommendations about whether the
   DV labeling values can be set only for what have been defined to date as
   "essential nutrients." For example, the FDA set a labeling value for
   "dietary fiber" without having the DV. Nutrient reference
   values-requirements are set by Codex Alimentarius for essential
   nutrients, and regulatory bodies in many countries use these Codex
   values in setting national policy for recommended dietary intakes.
   However, the focus of this conference is not on essential nutrients, but
   on the "nonessential nutrients," also termed dietary bioactive
   components. They can be defined as "Constituents in foods or dietary
   supplements, other than those needed to meet basic human nutritional
   needs, which are responsible for changes in health status (Office of
   Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office of Public Health and
   Science, Department of Health and Human Services in Fed Regist
   69:55821-55822, 2004)." Substantial and often persuasive scientific
   evidence does exist to confirm a relationship between the intake of a
   specific bioactive constituent and enhanced health conditions or reduced
   risk of a chronic disease. Further, research on the putative mechanisms
   of action of various classes of bioactives is supported by national and
   pan-national government agencies, and academic institutions, as well as
   functional food and dietary supplement manufacturers. Consumers are
   becoming educated and are seeking to purchase products containing
   bioactives, yet there is no evaluative process in place to let the
   public know how strong the science is behind the benefits or the
   quantitative amounts needed to achieve these beneficial health effects
   or to avoid exceeding the upper level (UL). When one lacks an essential
   nutrient, overt deficiency with concomitant physiological determents and
   eventually death are expected. The absence of bioactive substances from
   the diet results in suboptimal health, e.g., poor cellular and/or
   physiological function, which is relative and not absolute. Regrettably
   at this time, there is no DRI process to evaluate bioactives, although a
   recent workshop convened by the National Institutes of Health (Options
   for Consideration of Chronic Disease Endpoints for Dietary Reference
   Intakes (DRIs); March 10-11, 2015;
   http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dri/ ) did explore the process to
   develop DVs for nutrients, the lack of which result in increased risk of
   chronic disease (non-communicable disease) endpoints. A final report is
   expected soon. This conference (CRN-International Scientific Symposium;
   "Nutrient Reference Value-Non-Communicable Disease (NRV-NCD) Endpoints,"
   20 November in Kronberg, Germany; http://www.crn-i.ch/2015symposium/ )
   explores concepts related to the Codex NRV process, the public health
   opportunities in setting NRVs for bioactive constituents, and further
   research and details on the specific class of bioactives, n-3 long-chain
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (also termed omega-3 fatty acids) and their
   constituents, specifically docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic
   acid.

AB BACKGROUND: Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretic agents are being
   increasingly used at lower doses. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in the
   12.5-mg dose remains the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive agent
   in the United States.
   OBJECTIVES: This study compared chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg daily, with
   HCTZ, 12.5 mg daily, by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring
   and evaluated efficacy. Because HCTZ has been perceived as a
   short-acting drug, a third comparison with an extended-release
   formulation (HCTZ-controlled release [CR]) was added.
   METHODS: This 12-week comparative, double-blind, outpatient study
   randomized 54 patients with stage 1 hypertension to receive either
   chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg, (n = 16); HCTZ 12.5 mg (n = 18); or HCTZ-CR
   12.5 mg (n = 20). ABP monitoring was performed at baseline and after 4
   and 12 weeks of therapy.
   RESULTS: All 3 treatments significantly (p < 0.01) lowered office BP at
   weeks 4 and 12 from baseline. At weeks 4 and 12, significant reductions
   in systolic and diastolic 24-h ambulatory and nighttime BP (p < 0.01)
   were observed with chlorthalidone but not with HCTZ. At weeks 4 (p =
   0.015) and 12 (p = 0.020), nighttime systolic ABP was significantly
   lower in the chlorthalidone group than in the the HCTZ group. With HCTZ
   therapy, sustained hypertension was converted into masked hypertension.
   In contrast to the HCTZ group, the HCTZ-CR group also showed a
   significant (p < 0.01) reduction in 24-h ABP. All 3 treatments were
   generally safe and well tolerated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg daily,
   significantly reduced mean 24-h ABP as well as daytime and nighttime BP.
   Due to its short duration of action, no significant 24-h ABP reduction
   was seen with HCTZ, 12.5 mg daily, which merely converted sustained
   hypertension into masked hypertension. Thus, low-dose chlorthalidone,
   6.25 mg, could be used as monotherapy for treatment of essential
   hypertension, whereas low-dose HCTZ monotherapy is not an appropriate
   antihypertensive drug. (Comparative Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of
   Hydrochlorothiazide CR with Hydrochlorothiazide and Chlorthalidone in
   Patients With Stage I Essential Hypertension; CTRI/2013/07/003793).

AB BACKGROUND: The tactile perception is essential for all types of topical
   formulations (cosmetic, pharmaceutical, medical device) and the
   possibility to predict the sensorial response by using instrumental
   methods instead of sensory testing would save time and cost at an early
   stage product development. Here, we report on an instrumental evaluation
   method using tactile friction measurements to estimate perceptual
   attributes of topical formulations.
   METHODS: Friction was measured between an index finger and an artificial
   skin substrate after application of formulations using a force sensor.
   Both model formulations of liquid crystalline phase structures with
   significantly different tactile properties, as well as commercial
   pharmaceutical moisturizing creams being more tactile-similar, were
   investigated. Friction coefficients were calculated as the ratio of the
   friction force to the applied load. The structures of the model
   formulations and phase transitions as a result of water evaporation were
   identified using optical microscopy.
   RESULTS: The friction device could distinguish friction coefficients
   between the phase structures, as well as the commercial creams after
   spreading and absorption into the substrate. In addition, phase
   transitions resulting in alterations in the feel of the formulations
   could be detected. A correlation was established between skin hydration
   and friction coefficient, where hydrated skin gave rise to higher
   friction. Also a link between skin smoothening and finger friction was
   established for the commercial moisturizing creams, although further
   investigations are needed to analyse this and correlations with other
   sensorial attributes in more detail.
   CONCLUSION: The present investigation shows that tactile friction
   measurements have potential as an alternative or complement in the
   evaluation of perception of topical formulations.

AB Abstract The weathered hydrocarbons are mainly constituted of highly
   persistent heavy petroleum fractions. Thus, the soil chemical complexity
   delays the hydrocarbon biodegradation. The objective of this study was
   to increase the bioavailability of highly persistent compounds by
   obtaining the greatest nutritional conditions for indigenous
   microorganisms. A consortium was previously adapted in order to achieve
   the full potential of degradation through the biostimulation process
   which was carried out by the Plackett-Burman analytic method
   experiments. These experiments conducted to a specific combination of
   nutrients, which provided the minimum requirements for the
   hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria to efficiently improve their metabolic
   processes. The biodegradation of hydrocarbons were estimated based on
   the heavy oil/kg dry soil, CO2 production/kg dry soil, as well as the
   alteration of certain physicochemical characteristics, such as pH, EC
   (µS/cm), moisture and organic matter percentage. In conclusion, these
   analyses provide a contribution to the study of bioavailability of
   weathered hydrocarbons by controlling conditions in a nutrient
   biostimulation process and through the design of experiments. Likewise,
   a microbial consortium adapted to a 1 % concentration of Mayan crude,
   resulted in an up to 97 % increase in hydrocarbon degradation in the
   coastal weathered soil, which were expressed as a heavy fraction of
   hydrocarbons in a period of 28 days of degradation.
X4 Resumen Los hidrocarburos intemperizados presentan una composición
   formada principalmente por la fracción pesada del petróleo, los cuales
   son altamente persistentes. La complejidad química del suelo dificulta
   la biodegradación de los hidrocarburos. El objetivo de este trabajo fue
   incrementar la biodisponibilidad de hidrocarburos altamente
   persistentes, obteniendo las mejores condiciones nutrimentales para que
   los microorganismos nativos en un consorcio adaptado desarrollaran el
   máximo potencial de degradación en un suelo contaminado con
   hidrocarburos intemperizados, a través de un proceso de bioestimulación.
   Se utilizó un diseño de experimentos factorial fraccionado del tipo
   Plackett-Burman para encontrar la combinación de nutrientes específicos
   que aporten los requerimientos mínimos necesarios para que las bacterias
   hidrocarbonoclastas desarrollen sus procesos metabólicos de manera
   eficiente. La biodegradación de los hidrocarburos fue estimada con base
   en el contenido de hidrocarburos de fracción pesada (HFP)/kg suelo seco,
   producción de CO2/kg suelo seco, así como la alteración de algunas
   características fisicas y químicas como el pH, CE (µS/cm), porcentaje de
   humedad y porcentaje de materia orgánica. Este trabajo realiza una
   contribución al estudio de la biodisponibilidad de los hidrocarburos
   persistentes mediante el control de las condiciones nutrimentales en un
   proceso de bioestimulación a través de un diseño de experimentos. Por
   otro lado, la adición de un consorcio microbiano adaptado a
   concentraciones de 1 % de crudo Maya incrementó la degradación de los
   hidrocarburos intemperizados en el suelo costero hasta en un 97 %,
   expresados como HFP en un periodo de 28 días de degradación.
